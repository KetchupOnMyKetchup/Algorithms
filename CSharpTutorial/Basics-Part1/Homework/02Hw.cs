            // What value is num now?
            // Answer:


            // Call your method called ChangeNum, do not assign the method to a variable


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Set your variable num equal to the ChangeNum method


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Write a variable called num2 and set it equal to 99
            // Write a variable called num3 and set it equal to 500


            // Call your ChangeNum2 method and pass in num2, do not assign the method to a variable


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Set your variable num equal to the ChangeNum2 method


            // What value will num be now?
            // Answer:


            // Set your variable num equal to num3.
